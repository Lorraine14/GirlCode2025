Entelect and GirlCode hosted a highly engaging workshop that focused on modern web development practices. 
The session was practical in nature and provided us with hands-on experience in setting up and working with some of the most relevant tools in the industry today.

The workshop began with an introduction to React, one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. 
They explained its purpose, real-world applications and why it has become a standard choice for developing scalable front-end applications. 
We were guided step by step through the process of creating a React application from scratchâ€”starting with the installation of required technologies such as Node.js and npm.
Once the environment was set up, the instructors demonstrated how to generate a new React project, 
explaining the structure of the application folder and the role of key files such as index.js and App.js. 
They also introduced basic concepts such as components, props and state, ensuring that even beginners could follow along with confidence.

In addition to front-end development, the workshop placed strong emphasis on Git version control, a crucial skill for collaboration and project management. 
We were provided a thorough walkthrough of Git basics, including initializing a repository, staging and committing changes, branching, and merging. 
We also learned how to connect our local repositories to a remote one (e.g., GitHub), which is essential for teamwork and code sharing.
