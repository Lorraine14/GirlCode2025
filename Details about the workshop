Entelect and GirlCode hosted a highly engaging workshop that focused on modern web development practices. 
The session was practical in nature and provided us with hands-on experience in setting up and working with some of the most relevant tools in the industry today.

The workshop began with a structured, step-by-step guide on setting up the required technologies. We were shown how to install the necessary tools, 
including Node.js, React, and GitHub Desktop, ensuring that every participant could follow along and get their development environment ready.

Once the installations were complete, we were guided through the process of creating a React application from scratch. 
This included understanding the folder structure, learning about components, and writing basic code to see how React applications run in real time.

In addition to React, we were also introduced to Git version control using GitHub Desktop. 
They demonstrated how to create repositories, track changes, commit code, and push updates to GitHub. 
This practical hands-on session helped us understand how version control supports collaboration and ensures code safety in real-world projects.
